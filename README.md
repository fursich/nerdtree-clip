# nerdtree-iterm

## Introduction

This NERDTree plugin adds a NERDTree menu item to open the selected folder in iTerm. (i.e. open a shell window and cd to that folder)

## Installation

Copy the ```iterm_menu_item.vim``` file to ```~/.vim/nerdtree_plugin/``` (*nix) or ```~/vimfiles/nerdtree_plugin``` (windows).

## Usage

In the NERDTree window, select the desired folder and then type ```m``` and ```i```. If the selection is on a file, this plugin will open iTerm on the enclosing folder.
